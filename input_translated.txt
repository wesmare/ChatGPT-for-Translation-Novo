My house I live in a small but modern house in the city center. My house has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room, a kitchen, and a small terrace. In the afternoons, the sun warms the house for hours, so it’s usually not cold.
My favorite part of the house is the terrace because I can enjoy views of the city and read in complete silence there. The bathroom is small and uncomfortable, but I’m going to renovate it. When my friends come over, we all sit and chat in the living room.
I’ve been living in this house for four years. The building is modern and recently constructed. I really like the exterior, as it has attractive colors and a good appearance.
Since I arrived at this house, I’ve been living alone. The size is perfect for one person, but I could rent out the second bedroom to a friend. However, I like living alone.
I’m happy in this house and don’t plan on leaving for now. I have enough space for myself, and the kitchen is very well-equipped. I like cooking all kinds of dishes and eating in the living room while watching TV.
